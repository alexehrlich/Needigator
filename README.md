# Needigator
Needigator is an acronym of "needs" and "navigator". This is an application for any kind of market with listed products.
The user is able to search products and put them onto a shopping list. If a product is not available, the user is able to request it.
After selecting all the desired products this application calculates the shortest route through the supermarket to collect all the goods.
The user can watch the route on a 2D map (imaginary market) and follow the animated shopping baskets. When finsished the user is able to mark this list as a
favorite shopping list. Next time he can choose this list and start right from here.

# Purpose
This was a serious app project, which was presented to a local market. The feedback was great, but we did not get the deal, because the cooperative of this market
didn't want us to acces their product data base system - which of course is nessecary for this application.

Nevertheless I put a bunch of work in this and learned so much. Therefore I want to share it in my portfolio.

# Algortihm
The calculation bases on the simulated annelaing algorithm which solves the travelling salesman problem (k.a. TSP).
